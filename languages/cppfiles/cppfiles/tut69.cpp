/*******INTRODUCTION TO STL******/
/*
competitive programming me apne pas limited time hoga jab 
-> resize
-> sorting swapping some classes kuch b jinko short nd kam time mai
-> search an element inseet or delete nd alll in sbme time lgta jo apn stl sebht km time m reuse krk 
STL -. standard template library 

library of what ?
->generic classes and functions

why use stl ?
-> reuse : well tested classes components and fxns
-> time saving

COMPONENTS OF STL?
1. containers   -> stores data fo eg vector  containers are some implemented classes which someone has implemented and we can use then using library only
                -> use template classes
2. algorithms   -> sorting
                -> searching , merging inserting etc
                -> use template fxns
3. iterators    ->it is a object which points  to an element in a container 
                ->handled just like pointers
                -> cnnects algorithms with connectors
  iterator moves as insructed by the agorithm

* stl is used because its a good idea not to einvent the wheel
