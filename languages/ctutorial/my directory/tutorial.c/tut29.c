// WHY WAS RECURSIVE APPROACH SLLOW ?
fibonnaci example
YHA ek recursive value ko evaluate krne m ek hi terms bht br l;g rhi h 
or iterative m 4 loop chlaya or bs add kro 
but isme br br ek hi fxn ko 
time complexity increase ho jati hai

IN A NUTSHELL
-> recursiob is a good approach when it comes to problem solving
-> however , programmer needs to evaluate the need and inpact of using rec / iterative approach while solving a particular prblm
-> in case of factorial calculation , rec saved a lot of lines  in code
-> however in case of fibonacci series, rc result in some extra unnecessary fxn calls which was an extra overhead!
-> running time for fibonacci series grows exponentially with input i case of  rec approach
