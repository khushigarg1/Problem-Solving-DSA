/*
ex- lets say i want to create a software development for college university
then  we will need 1-2 students professors table classroom, staff member , committee memebr , nd many more things that we can say this will be behave like objects
this will make our code easy to initialise visualise nd all 
students has some properties like name roll no, age , address, contact naumber nd many mmore
functions like basically a task that we can perform all on over obbjects
    like changeaddress , setrollnum , nd many more

lets imagine 
we need 20 students and theri properties are roll no, name , age 
if we want to create 20 students then we should have three all properteis to every student 
roll number , name , age
explanantion sb stduenst ko deni pdegi isk aps ye ye nd all

so ek hi information apnko bar bar deni pdhr hi usk lye apn 
ek template bana skte hai jisk name ho gya students and usk pas hai hr studnets k pas roll num, age , name hoga 
so isk bd sirf every students k pas iski copy bhej denge taki thoda easy

OOPS -> class is a blueprint thaht defines all properties of our objects dn all
     -> objects
